The product manager communicates the scope and timeline required by the business. After
negotiating the tech lead and trying to refine the scope to have it fit in the timeline,
the **tech lead** might come to the conclusion that more capacity is needed for the team.
Then the tech lead will discuss the matter with their manager and the request will climb
up the chain of command and the conclusion will come down the line. If the conclusion is
that no additional capacity can be allocated, the tech lead will communicate this with the
product manager and the product manager will communicate the required change in timeline
to the business. Otherwise, the decision maker will inform HR to initiate the hiring process.
