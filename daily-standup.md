# Daily progress update meeting

## The Flow
1. Someone (known ahead and agreed on) will open the project board on the daily view and share their screan on the digital platform in which they daily takes place.
2. The board will be filtered based on assignee and we will iterate over the team members. (Only items of the project board will be discussed)
3. For each team member we will discuss all the tasks that have had progress or status change since the last daily or are expected to have such changes before the next daily.
4. If someone is blocked by something or someone else this will be mentioned.

Note: The daily meeting should begin at least 3 minutes after its scheduled time and should end within 15 minutes. The punctuality and active presence in the meeting is critical and should me meticulously monitored and tracked. 

## The Project Board
In the daily progress update meeting, a team member(usually the technical lead of the team) should happen according Project Board to make sure that
* Tasks progress in their lifecycle accurately.
* The board accurately represents the state of the project. (Refer to project-board.md for why this is neccesary)
* We don't miss anything that needs to be mentioned in the daily meeting.
* We don't derail the daily meeting with irrelevant topics. (See below)

## Topic
> The daily standup meeting **is** a specific meeting with a clear topic.
> 
> The daily standup meeting **is not** the daily meeting in which the team gather and discuss the team matters.

Often, someone has something in their head that they think is very important and everyone should know about it, they should be very careful not to discuss such matters in the daily progress update meetings, they can however mention that there is a matter that needs to be discussed and schedule a separate meeting for that matter.

If an issue is really important, it is worth having a separate meeting that has a clear and specific topic. A meeting that will lead to specific decisions and actions that will be clearly noted by the members of the meeting. This is not simply because we don't want to waste the time of the other team members by having them stay and listen to off-topic matters in the daily meeting. It is more importantly because we doin't want to waste the time and energy of the team by having them discuss the same matter so many times without getting any specifc results or outcomes.

## Timeboxing
As the title evidently goes, the daily-standup is a meeting that takes place every single day. too long is headache and also next meeting. #TODO
