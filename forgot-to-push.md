Without a push-to-forget button. There is no way to forget-to-push.

Why "I Forgot to Push My Code" is Never an Acceptable Excuse for Developers

The all-too-common excuse "I forgot to push my code." holds no water in the fast-paced,
collaborative world of programming.

Developers typically break down their work into small chunks, each of which corresponds to
a commit-a list of changes to the code that serve a specific purpose, briefly described in
the corresponding commit message. Several commits are then batched into a pull request
and, upon approval, are merged into the codebase.

A mindful developer is supposed to be conscious about what they are doing at every moment
of their working time. Now, I would like to "rewrite git's history" and claim that
a "commit" was named a "commit" because the developer is supposed to commit to it. Upon
deciding to get a commit-that is, a small chunk of work with a meaningful impact on the
progress of a task-done, the developer should sit behind their keyboard and focus on their
goal until it is done. Then, knowing what they just did, they will write a proper commit
message and conclude their chunk of work.

We should push our code with punctuality because we don't code in isolation
* It's not just a technical step.
* It's about making the work accessible to the rest of the team.
* It's to maintain a clear history of changes.

So, next time you want to say that you forgot to push your code, just don't!
